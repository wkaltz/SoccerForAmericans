<header><h1>Welcome to an Introduction to Understanding English Football and the Point System</h1></header>
<p>When first starting to really get into soccer most Americans, including myself, are drawn to the Premiere League. The Premiere League is by far the most competitive league in the world. Almost every single team in the Premiere League is world class, which adds to the


    appeal for anyone trying to get into soccer. The best part is that the Premiere League is played in England, which means</p>
<div class="left"><img src="prem2.png" alt="Prem Logo"></div>
<p>the main language spoke is English, perfect for most of us Americans who don't speak another language. What most people don't realize is that there are</p>
<div class="right"><img src="rashford.jpg" alt="Marcus Rashford"></div>
<p>actually five tiers of professional English football, with there being even more non-professional leagues below that. To better understand how English Football works, we will use the Premiere League as an example.  There are twenty teams that play in the English Premiere League. Each team plays thirty eight games in a season, which is playing every
    other team in the league at home and away. The Premiere League operates on a point system to determine the best and worst teams, instead of a win and loss system that all sports in the United States use. When your teams wins they get three points. When a game ends in a draw, both teams walk away with one point. When your team loses, they walk away with zero points. The Premiere League table, as seen on the right, shows the position of the team, as well as the amount of matches they have played, their goal difference,</p>
<p> and the amount of points they have. A teams goal difference is the amount of goals they scored compared to the amount of goals other team scored against them. To find the goal difference, subtract a teams scored goals by the amount of goals scored against them. The goal difference is a huge factor, because whenever two teams have the same amount of points, the tiebreaker is each teams goal difference. You might be asking yourself why do points matter? It's time to talk about relegation and
    promotion. I will use the league of English football right under the Premiere League, called the Championship, to explain relegation and promotion. In the case of the championship, the two teams with the highest amount of points will be promoted to the Premiere League. Then, the teams who finished third, fourth, fifth, and sixth in the table will have a playoff to determine the third team to get promoted. </p>

<p> It is important to note that play off games cannot end in a tie, and if both teams reach the end of extra time tied up, it will go into a penalty shootout to determine the winner. The teams who finish at the bottom of the table will get relegated, which means they will play in the league below them next season. This means that the three teams who get promoted to the Premiere League from the Championship will get replaced by the three teams who are relegated from the Premiere League. This gives an opportunity for those lower market teams to perform at the top level of English Football and make a name for themselves. Most leagues around the world, except for the MLS (Major League Soccer) which is in the United States.</p>
