    <h1>About my site</h1> </header> <br>
<h3>My goal for this website is to encourage people who are not familiar with soccer to try and give it a shot. A lot of people living in the United States have this sort of bias that soccer is boring.
    I was one of those Americans. But, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I decided I wanted to try something new. I stepped into the world of soccer with zero knowledge about the game.
    The world of soccer is completely different from the sports scene here in the United States. It is complicated and it took me a while to fully understand the system. My goal for this website is to
    encourage new viewers of soccer to enjoy the beautiful game while at the same time stream-lining the learning process. Soccer has given me some of my most enjoyable moments over the past few years, and I hope to share the same experiences with others.</h3>
