<header><h1>Welcome to an Introduction to the Champions League and Other European Competitions.</h1></header>
<p>The UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League is the most prestigious club competition in the world. The best clubs around Europe compete to lift the Champions League trophy, making the winner objectively the best club in the world. The Champions League follows the same format as the World Cup, eight groups of four, top two teams on points go on to the round of sixteen. There are multiple different ways to qualify for the Champions League. The most common way is to finish at the top of close to the top of your league. For example, in the Premiere League, the top four clubs you finish with the most point will qualify for the Champions League. The number of qualifiers for each league will obviously differ, with their being a different amount of team competing in</p>

<p>each league. You can also qualify by winning the UEFA Europa League. The Europa League is still a very important competition, with some of the best clubs in the world competing in the tournament. There are a few different ways to qualify for the Europa League. With the Premiere League, the fifth place finisher will go on to compete in the Europa League. You can also qualify for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup, which is the biggest club tournament in English football. This can cause some very odd scenarios. For example in the</p>

<p>  2012-13 FA Cup, underdogs Wigan Athletic won the FA Cup. They would go on to play in the Europa League, something no one would ever expected to happen. Although they finished bottom of their group in the Europa League, it still proved that any club has a chance at making the tournament. As said the before, the winner of the Europa League will go on to compete in the Champions League. You can also qualify for the Europa League by winning the Conference League, UEFA's new competition. The Conference League was introduced in 2021, becoming the third and final UEFA club competition. In the case of English football, you qualify for the conference league by winning the Carabao Cup, another big club tournament in English football. However, if the winner of the Carabao Cup finishes high in the league and qualifies for either the Europa League or the Champions League, the Conference League spot is given to the team that finishes sixth in the Premiere League.
